Website For (some of) Ali's Art

Created using: Reactjs, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

website to show my art. I was inspired by Spotify and my desktop.

Features: 
  - click and drag "applications"
  - embedded song with ability to pause and play 
  

To fix:
  - the volume button is bugged
  - mobile drag or drop doesn't work without the screen being dragged as well
